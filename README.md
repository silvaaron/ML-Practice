# ML-Practice
This repository hosts sample projects that I will be working on while learning ML.<br><br>
Brief overview of the projects is as follows
1. Estimating wine quality<br>
The objective here is to predict the quality of a wine given some of its characteristics.<br>
This will be done by building a suitable supervised learning model using regression.<br><br>
